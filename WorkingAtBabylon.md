Working in the iOS team
==================================

TODO

### Where do we store our code?
We use Github. We have a central repo that hosts the main and white label apps, and a few Open Source projects that we created and rely on.

### CI - how many targets 

* What architectural patterns are you using to make development easier or more consistent? What problems with your current approach have you come across after settling on one (if you have one)?


to ask
* VCS? Github/gitlab?
* CI ?
    * How many apps/targets/schemes?
    * How big is your Fastfile?
    * Does it have several environment references?
    * Can you dry run a lane on your machine right now?
    * Codesigning?
* What architectural patterns are you using to make development easier or more consistent? What problems with your current approach have you come across after settling on one (if you have one)?
* Team/People
    * comms - slack?
Slack, as a non-trivial part of the team is remote. Zoom for meetings.

    * Do people ever take sick days to get work done?
No.

    * When was the last time someone worked a late night/weekend in order to meet a deadline?
    * How many meetings do you have in a day?
It depend on the squad you’re assigned. For Enrolment and Integrity I counted 18 in a typical sprint, so that averages to ~2 a day. Note that quite a few of them are optional.

    * Does your calendar look like a losing game of tetris? Do you have large continuous uninterrupted hours?
Most of the meetings are on the first Monday/Tuesday of the sprint.

    * Are there any private spaces in your office?
    * Is there a gym/field/court close to your office for physical activity?
There is a commercial gym close by, a park, and a barebone gym in the office. There’s also free yoga twice a week.

    * Do people feel comfortable calling attention to systemic issues/heavily “band-aid”-ed systems?
    * Are any of your engineering managers mobile engineers? Do mobile devs feel like they have to learn backend dev to "prove themselves" / feel like they have a seat at the table?
iOS engineers have to know iOS, and that’s it.

* Designers?
    * What’s the handoff process like?
    * Do you let devs get down and dirty with sketch files?
    * Do you focus on making your android and iOS apps look consistent?
There is a drive for consistency with a design system, but platform-specific conventions are taken into account.

    * Example of the above: Do you have the “title” of a VC on the left in iOS/on the center in android for consistency? Do you have a modal View Controller presented with a back arrow on the left?
* Q/A?
    * What’s the handoff-to-QA process like?
* Learning
    * Do you sponsor conference tickets?
    * Books/online resources?
* Product
    * Do devs get access to support tickets?
    * How involved are devs in product decisions?
    * Do you consider the societal impact of the products you’re making?
    * Does your marketing org ensure your marketing materials are inclusive (I like to call this the Revolut filter) ?
