Fastlane Match
==============

Fastlane match is a tool for managing certificates and provisioning profiles centrally. It downloads certificates and profiles from a GitHub repository or Google Cloud Storage bucket. For safety, centrally stored files are encrypted.

## Installing Certificates and Provisioning Profiles Locally

For day to day development work it usually suffices to navigate to the project directory in a terminal shell and run the command

```shell
 $ fastlane match development --read-only
```

Certificates and provisioning profiles for enterprise builds (Hockey App) or release builds (Testflight and the App Store) can also be downloaded. Normally, this is not needed but might be necessary if you want to run UI tests locally or work on updating our fastlane build scripts.

To install certificates and provisioning profiles for creating a Testflight or App Store build locally, run the command

```shell
 $ fastlane match release git_branch:"release team id" --read-only
```

For a Hockeyapp build

```shell
 $ fastlane match enterprise --read-only
```

More information about available options can be found below and in the fastlane match [documentation](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/).

## Several Targets and Teams

Recommended practise is to have on branch per team. It is also possible to create branches for different bundle identifiers should it get messy with a lot of app identifiers for one team. Default values for the git URL, branch, app identifier and build type are read from the `Matchfile`.

It can happen that code signing certificates for more than one target or type are needed for a build. This can be handled by making several calls to match.

```ruby
match(app_identifier: "com.best.app.ever.seriously", type: "adhoc", git_branch: "best_app_ever_ad_hoc_signing")
match(app_identifier: "com.best.app.ever.seriously", type: "development", git_branch: "best_app_ever_dev_signing")
```

Repository URLs can be found in the [new hires checklist](https://github.com/Babylonpartners/ios-playbook#4-new-hires-checklist). Information about which branches we use for different Babylon apps can be found in our internal Confluence Wiki.

## Update Contents Manually

Apple does not allow more than two distribution certificates per account, so it can happen that fastlane match cannot create a new distribution certificate and is unable to figure out which existing certificate to link with a new provisioning profile. Fastlane match provides a utility for nuking all existing certificates and provisioning profiles and replace them with new ones generated by fastlane match. This is, however, not always advisable. Nuking existing enterprise certificates can be a really bad idea as in house apps will stop working.

Since the files in the GitHub repository are encrypted they cannot be updated directly. Fastlane Match provides a couple of helper functions. To clone the repository, open a ruby console and call `Match::GitHelper.clone`. Babylon specific credentials can be found in the iOS 1Password vault.

```shell
$ bundle console
irb(main):001:0> require 'match'
=> true
irb(main):002:0> branch = 'build_target'
=> "build_target"
irb(main):003:0> git_url = 'https://github.com/path/to/fastlane/match/repo'
=> "https://github.com/path/to/fastlane/match/repo"
irb(main):004:0> shallow_clone = false
=> false
irb(main):005:0> password = 'long-and-super-secret'
=> "long-and-super-secret"
irb(main):006:0> workspace = Match::GitHelper.clone(git_url, shallow_clone, manual_password: password, branch: branch)
[14:22:10]: Cloning remote git repo…
[14:22:10]: If cloning the repo takes too long, you can use the `clone_branch_directly` option in match.
[14:22:12]: Checking out branch build_target…
[14:22:12]: 🔓  Successfully decrypted certificates repo
=> "/var/folders/8k/r0x0ys_927q8vq5_tq01ntjd2b03m3/T/d20190228-92193-16w4fz2"
```

Open another terminal session and navigate to the folder name returned by `Match::GitHelper.clone`. Once all edits are complete, return to the ruby console.

```shell
irb(main):007:0> commit_message = 'Updated provisioning profiles to be great again.'
=> "Updated provisioning profiles to be great again.”
irb(main):008:> Match::GitHelper.commit_changes(workspace, commit_message, git_url, branch)
[14:28:44]: 🔒  Successfully encrypted certificates repo
[14:28:44]: Pushing changes to remote git repo…
=> nil
```

It can be convenient to store the password in the environment hash

```shell
irb(main):008:> ENV[“MATCH_PASSWORD"] = 'long-and-super-secret'
```

The password itself can be found in the iOS team 1Password vault.

Certificates are stored in three folders

```shell
 certs/development
 certs/distribution
 certs/enterprise
```

It might be necessary to manually make a certificate available in both the enterprise and distribution folder. Copying the files did not work (February 2019), but adding a soft link did.

Fastlane match expects the filename for the .p12 and .cer to be `certificate id`.p12 and `certificate id`.cer, whereas manually generated certificates that have been downloaded from the developer portal are named `team id`.cer and `team id`.p12.

Fastlane has a utility for interacting with Apple Developer Portal and the App Store Connect API called [spaceship](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/spaceship). There were some problems (March 2019) with running `bundle exec fastlane spaceship`. It might be necessary to manually install some gems in the `~/.fastlane` directory.

The certificate id can be found by inspecting the certificate in the spaceship playground.

```shell
$ fastlane spaceship
…
Username: apple_developer_id@icloud.com
Logging into to iTunes Connect (apple_developer_id@icloud.com)...
Successfully logged in to iTunes Connect
Logging into the Developer Portal (apple_developer_id@icloud.com)...
Successfully logged in to the Developer Portal

[1] pry(#<Spaceship::Playground>)> certificates = Spaceship::Portal.certificate.all
The current user is in 2 teams. Pass a team ID or call `select_team` to choose a team. Using the first one for now.
=> [<Spaceship::Portal::Certificate::Development
        id="CV89FKERTS",
        name="iOS Development",
        status="Issued",
        created=2018-03-05 20:54:38 UTC,
        expires=2019-03-05 20:44:38 UTC,
        owner_type="teamMember",
        owner_name="Latosius Silversong",
        owner_id="BH9RFFETSAS",
        type_display_id="6FG4WEDART",
        can_download=true>,
...
```

Fastlane spaceship will prompt for a password if it is not available.
It seems that fastlane match cannot always figure out when to re-use an existing certificate (February 2019) for a new provisioning profile.

Provisioning profiles are stored in

```shell
profiles/adhoc
profiles/appstore
profiles/development
profiles/enterprise
```

Fastlane match requires that provisioning profiles are named AdHoc_`bundle identifier`.mobileprovision, AppStore_`bundle identifier`.mobileprovision, Development_`bundle identifier`.mobileprovision or InHouse_`bundle identifier`.mobileprovision.
